Hello.

You are probably wondering why this is here.

Git unfortunately does not include a way to push empty directories, which is unfortunate because I wanted a default directory for images to be downloaded to to be included.

But obviously it would be silly to push thousands of images to this repo.

So that is why this is here.

Anyway here is something really cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
